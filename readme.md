Blogging Platform
Objective:

Create a RESTful API for a blogging platform that allows users to create, read,
update, and delete blog posts. Additionally, implement user authentication and
authorization mechanisms, and ensure the security and scalability of the application.

Requirements:

User Authentication and Authorization:
● Implement user registration and authentication using JSON Web
Tokens (JWT).
● Create roles for users (e.g., regular user and admin) and implement
role-based access control for certain API endpoints.

Blog Post Management:
● Allow users to create, retrieve, update, and delete blog posts.
● Each blog post should have a title, content, author, and timestamp.
● Implement validation to ensure that only authenticated users can
perform CRUD operations on their own posts.

Database Integration:
● Use MongoDB as the database for storing blog posts.
● Implement a connection to the MongoDB database using Mongoose.
● Ensure that the application gracefully handles database errors and
connection issues.

Middleware Usage:
● Implement middleware for logging requests and responses.
● Create a custom middleware for handling authentication and
authorization.

Error Handling:
● Implement robust error handling for API endpoints, providing
meaningful error messages.
● Ensure that errors in database operations are caught and handled
appropriately.

Testing:
● Write unit tests for critical parts of the application, such as
authentication middleware and database operations.
● Use a testing framework of your choice (e.g., Mocha, Jest).

Security:
● Sanitize user input to prevent common security vulnerabilities like SQL
injection and cross-site scripting (XSS).
● Implement secure password storage using hashing algorithms.

Scalability and Performance:
● Optimize the API for performance, considering scenarios with a large
number of concurrent users.
● Implement caching mechanisms where appropriate.
● Discuss and implement strategies for horizontal scaling if needed.

Documentation:
● Provide clear and comprehensive API documentation using tools like
Swagger or Postman.
● Include information on authentication, available endpoints,
request/response formats, and error handling.

Versioning:
● Implement versioning in the API to handle future updates without
breaking existing clients.

Deliverables:
● Complete source code of the Node.js application.
● Documentation covering setup instructions, API documentation, and any
additional notes for developers.

We will evaluate your work with Node.js, Express.js, MongoDB, middleware,
authentication, error handling, testing, security best practices, and considerations for
scalability and performance.
The candidate's approach to problem-solving and the quality of the delivered code
will give us valuable insights into their skill set.
